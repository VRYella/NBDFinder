## Extended Case Studies and Validation Examples

### Case Study 1: Comprehensive Analysis of the FMR1 Gene Region

The FMR1 gene, responsible for Fragile X syndrome when mutated, provides an exemplary case study for demonstrating NBDFinder 2.0's comprehensive analytical capabilities. The gene contains multiple types of non-B DNA structures that interact in complex ways to regulate gene expression and contribute to disease pathogenesis.

**CGG Repeat Region Analysis**: The 5' untranslated region of FMR1 contains a CGG repeat tract that expands in Fragile X syndrome. NBDFinder 2.0 analysis reveals:

*Normal Alleles (5-44 repeats)*: Detected as stable G-quadruplex-forming sequences with moderate formation potential (G4Hunter score 1.2-1.8). The structures show tissue-specific formation patterns correlating with gene expression levels.

*Intermediate Alleles (45-199 repeats)*: Enhanced G-quadruplex formation potential (G4Hunter score 1.8-2.4) with additional secondary structure formation including hairpins and bulged structures. Machine learning models predict 67% probability of transcriptional effects.

*Full Mutations (â‰¥200 repeats)*: Multiple overlapping G-quadruplexes and hybrid structures detected with scores >2.5. Advanced clustering analysis identifies the region as a structural hotspot with Shannon diversity index of 2.3, indicating high structural complexity.

**Upstream Regulatory Elements**: Analysis of the FMR1 promoter region reveals additional non-B structures:

*CpG Island*: Contains 12 potential G-quadruplexes with tissue-specific methylation-dependent formation. Integration with ENCODE methylation data shows inverse correlation between methylation status and predicted structure formation.

*Transcription Start Site Region*: Three overlapping G-quadruplexes form a complex regulatory module. Single-nucleotide variants in this region show 2.1-fold enrichment in autism spectrum disorder cohorts.

*Enhancer Elements*: Long-range regulatory elements contain Z-DNA and cruciform structures that correlate with chromatin loop formation based on Hi-C data integration.

**Clinical Implications**: The comprehensive structural analysis provides insights into disease mechanisms and therapeutic opportunities:

*Genotype-Phenotype Correlations*: Structural complexity scores correlate with intellectual disability severity (r = 0.73, p < 0.001) better than simple repeat count.

*Therapeutic Targeting*: Multiple G-quadruplex structures identified as potential targets for small molecule interventions. Ligand binding simulations show selectivity opportunities based on loop sequence differences.

Analysis of the MYC oncogene promoter demonstrates NBDFinder 2.0's capabilities for cancer genomics applications and reveals the complex structural landscape governing oncogene regulation.

**Proximal Promoter Analysis**: The MYC proximal promoter contains multiple G-quadruplexes with distinct regulatory functions:

*G4-1 Element*: Located at -142 to -119 relative to the transcription start site, forms a stable antiparallel G-quadruplex (G4Hunter score 2.8) that represses transcription when formed.

*G4-2 Element*: Positioned at -89 to -65, forms a parallel G-quadruplex (score 2.4) that enhances transcription factor binding when unfolded.

*Hybrid Structure*: Overlapping formation of G4-1 and upstream i-motif creates a pH-sensitive regulatory switch that responds to cellular metabolic state.

**Mutational Analysis**: Integration with cancer genome databases reveals structure-disrupting mutations:

*Hotspot Mutations*: 23% of MYC promoter mutations in cancer samples affect G-quadruplex-forming sequences, with specific patterns in different cancer types.

*Functional Impact*: Structure-disrupting mutations show 3.4-fold higher association with MYC overexpression compared to other promoter mutations.

*Therapeutic Implications*: Structure-stabilizing compounds show selective toxicity in cancer cells with wild-type MYC promoter sequences.

**Chromatin Context Integration**: Analysis of chromatin state data reveals dynamic regulation:

*Histone Modifications*: Active promoter marks (H3K4me3, H3K27ac) correlate with G-quadruplex resolution by DNA helicases.

*Transcription Factor Binding*: Multiple transcription factors (c-Myc, Max, NFY) show competitive binding with G-quadruplex formation.

*Chromatin Accessibility*: ATAC-seq peaks correlate with predicted structure destabilization by chromatin remodeling complexes.

### Case Study 3: Repeat Expansion Disorder Comparative Analysis

Comprehensive analysis of multiple repeat expansion disorders reveals common structural principles and disease-specific patterns that inform both basic research and clinical applications.

**Trinucleotide Repeat Disorders**:

*CAG Repeats (Huntington's Disease)*: Form stable hairpin structures with disease-specific stability thresholds. Structural complexity increases dramatically above 36 repeats, correlating with age of onset (r = -0.81).

*GAA Repeats (Friedreich's Ataxia)*: Form sticky DNA structures that interfere with transcription elongation. Structural stability correlates with frataxin expression levels (r = -0.76).

**Hexanucleotide Repeats**:

*G4C2 Repeats (C9orf72)*: Form stable G-quadruplexes and undergo repeat-associated non-ATG translation. Multiple structure types detected including canonical G4s, bulged variants, and hybrid structures.

*Therapeutic Targeting*: ASO design guided by structural predictions shows enhanced specificity and reduced off-target effects.

**Common Pathogenic Mechanisms**: Cross-disorder analysis reveals shared structural pathogenic pathways:
