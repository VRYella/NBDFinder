# NBDFinder: A Comprehensive Computational Framework for High-Throughput Detection and Analysis of Non-B DNA Structural Motifs

## Abstract

Non-canonical DNA secondary structures, collectively termed non-B DNA, play crucial roles in genome regulation, DNA replication, recombination, and disease pathogenesis. Despite mounting evidence of their biological significance, comprehensive computational tools for detecting and analyzing the full spectrum of non-B DNA structures remain limited. Here we present NBDFinder, an advanced computational framework that implements the first systematic classification of non-B DNA into 10 major structural classes encompassing 22 distinct subclasses: Curved DNA (global and local curvature), Slipped DNA (direct repeats and short tandem repeats), Cruciform DNA, R-loops, Triplex structures (triplex and sticky DNA), G-Quadruplex family (seven variants including multimeric, canonical, relaxed, bulged, bipartite, imperfect, and G-triplex intermediates), i-motif family (canonical, relaxed, and AC-motifs), Z-DNA (canonical and extruded-G variants), Hybrid motifs, and Non-B DNA cluster regions. NBDFinder incorporates state-of-the-art detection algorithms with enhanced scoring systems, implements hierarchical priority filtering for overlapping motifs, and provides comprehensive clinical variant classification for disease-associated repeat expansions. Through systematic benchmarking against established tools and validation using well-characterized genomic regions including telomeres, oncogene promoters, and disease-associated loci, NBDFinder demonstrates superior sensitivity and specificity in motif detection. Application to famous disease genes including HTT, FMR1, DMPK, and C9orf72 reveals novel insights into non-B DNA landscapes and their potential roles in pathogenesis. The platform features an intuitive web interface, supports multiple input formats, and provides interactive visualization with detailed sequence annotations. NBDFinder represents a significant advancement in non-B DNA research, offering researchers across disciplines a comprehensive, user-friendly tool for genome-scale structural analysis.

## Introduction

The discovery that genomic DNA can adopt alternative conformations beyond the canonical Watson-Crick B-form has fundamentally transformed our understanding of genome architecture and function. Since the landmark identification of Z-DNA by Wang and colleagues in 1979, the catalog of non-canonical DNA structures has expanded dramatically to encompass G-quadruplexes, i-motifs, cruciforms, R-loops, and numerous other configurations collectively termed "non-B DNA" structures¹⁻³. Far from being rare structural anomalies, these alternative conformations are now recognized as widespread throughout genomes, with conservative estimates suggesting they comprise 4-13% of the human genome under physiological conditions⁴⁻⁶.

The biological significance of non-B DNA structures extends across virtually all aspects of genome biology. G-quadruplexes, formed by guanine-rich sequences through Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding, serve as critical regulators of telomere maintenance, oncogene expression, and immunoglobulin class switching⁷⁻⁹. Z-DNA, characterized by its left-handed helical structure favored by alternating purine-pyrimidine sequences, functions in transcriptional regulation and immune recognition¹⁰⁻¹². Cruciform structures, arising from palindromic inverted repeats, provide recognition sites for DNA repair enzymes and transcription factors¹³⁻¹⁵. R-loops, triple-stranded nucleic acid structures containing an RNA-DNA hybrid and displaced single-stranded DNA, play essential roles in transcription termination, immunoglobulin class switching, and genome instability¹⁶⁻¹⁸.

Perhaps most clinically relevant are the connections between non-B DNA structures and human disease. Trinucleotide repeat expansions, which can form hairpin and cruciform structures, underlie more than 40 neurological disorders including Huntington disease, fragile X syndrome, and spinocerebellar ataxias¹⁹⁻²¹. G-quadruplex structures in oncogene promoters contribute to transcriptional dysregulation in cancer²²⁻²⁴. R-loop accumulation has been implicated in neurodegeneration and cancer progression²⁵⁻²⁷. The recent discovery of novel structures such as AC-motifs and extruded-G Z-DNA (eGZ) has further expanded the repertoire of disease-associated non-B DNA conformations²⁸⁻³⁰.

Despite the fundamental importance of non-B DNA structures, computational tools for their detection and analysis have evolved in a fragmented manner. Early efforts focused on individual structure types, with specialized algorithms developed for G-quadruplexes (G4Hunter, QGRS Mapper), Z-DNA (Z-Hunt, ZhuntLSC), and triplex structures (Triplexator)³¹⁻³⁶. While these tools demonstrated utility for their specific targets, they suffer from several limitations: narrow structural scope, lack of standardized classification schemes, absence of integrated visualization capabilities, and limited consideration of structural competition and overlap. More comprehensive platforms such as the non-B DNA Motif Search Tool (nBMST) and Non-B DB attempted to address these issues by incorporating multiple motif types, but they remain constrained by consensus sequence-based approaches and lack sophisticated scoring systems³⁷⁻³⁹.

The challenge of comprehensive non-B DNA analysis is compounded by the inherent complexity of these structures. DNA sequences can adopt multiple alternative conformations depending on sequence context, supercoiling, ionic conditions, and protein interactions. Competition between different structural possibilities means that the mere presence of a potential motif sequence does not guarantee structure formation. Furthermore, the discovery of new structural variants and hybrid conformations continues to expand the definitional boundaries of non-B DNA.

Here we present NBDFinder, a next-generation computational framework that addresses these challenges through several key innovations. First, we implement a comprehensive, systematically organized classification system encompassing 10 major non-B DNA classes and 22 distinct subclasses based on structural and functional criteria. Second, we develop enhanced detection algorithms that incorporate multiple scoring methodologies, thermodynamic considerations, and biological constraints. Third, we implement hierarchical priority systems to address structural competition and overlap, particularly within the G-quadruplex family where canonical structures take precedence over variants. Fourth, we provide extensive clinical annotation capabilities for disease-associated repeat expansions, incorporating the latest clinical guidelines and population data. Finally, we deliver these capabilities through an intuitive web-based interface with comprehensive visualization and analysis tools.

## Methods

### System Architecture and Design

NBDFinder employs a modular, scalable architecture designed to accommodate the diverse computational requirements of non-B DNA detection while maintaining high performance and user accessibility. The system consists of three primary components: a backend detection engine implemented in Python with optimized algorithms for each structural class, a comprehensive database of motif definitions and clinical annotations, and a web-based frontend developed using Streamlit for interactive analysis and visualization.

The backend detection engine is organized into ten specialized modules corresponding to the major non-B DNA classes. Each module implements structure-specific algorithms tailored to the unique characteristics of its target motifs. The modular design facilitates independent optimization of detection parameters, incorporation of new structural variants, and systematic benchmarking against experimental data. All modules share a common interface that standardizes input processing, coordinate systems, and output formatting to ensure consistency across the platform.

Input processing supports multiple formats including raw DNA sequences, FASTA files, and direct NCBI accession queries. Sequences undergo standardization through uppercase conversion, U→T substitution for RNA inputs, and removal of non-nucleotide characters. Quality control measures include length validation, alphabet verification, and detection of ambiguous nucleotides. For genomic sequences exceeding memory limitations, NBDFinder implements streaming analysis with overlapping windows to ensure complete motif detection across boundaries.

### Comprehensive Motif Classification System

NBDFinder implements the first systematic classification of non-B DNA structures into a hierarchical taxonomy of 10 major classes encompassing 22 distinct subclasses. This classification system was developed through comprehensive literature review, expert consultation, and structural analysis to provide complete coverage of known non-B DNA conformations while maintaining biological relevance and computational tractability.

**Class 1: Curved DNA** encompasses structures that deviate from linear B-form geometry through intrinsic sequence-dependent bending. The global curvature subclass identifies periodic arrangements of A/T tracts that create sustained directional bending, while the local curvature subclass detects isolated bendable sequences. Detection algorithms implement curvature prediction models based on dinucleotide bend angles and phasing analysis.

**Class 2: Slipped DNA** includes structures formed by strand misalignment during DNA replication, resulting in hairpin or loop-out configurations. The direct repeat subclass targets tandem duplications capable of forming slipped-strand structures, while the short tandem repeat (STR) subclass focuses on microsatellites with high slippage propensity. Algorithms consider repeat unit length, copy number, and sequence composition in scoring potential slipped structures.

**Class 3: Cruciform DNA** identifies four-way junction structures formed by inverted repeat sequences. The single subclass encompasses both cruciform and hairpin configurations arising from palindromic sequences, with detection based on palindrome identification, thermodynamic stability prediction, and stem-loop analysis.

**Class 4: R-loops** detects triple-stranded structures containing RNA-DNA hybrids and displaced single-stranded DNA. The detection algorithm implements the R-loop Forming Sequence (RLFS) model with enhanced scoring for GC skew, polypurine/polypyrimidine tracts, and thermodynamic stability.

**Class 5: Triplex structures** encompasses two distinct subclasses: classical triplex DNA formed by mirror repeat sequences through Hoogsteen base pairing, and sticky DNA characterized by GAA/TTC repeats that form stable triple helices. Detection algorithms evaluate purine/pyrimidine content, mirror symmetry, and triplex-forming potential.

**Class 6: G-Quadruplex Family** represents the most structurally diverse class with seven distinct subclasses arranged in order of detection priority: multimeric G4 (tandem quadruplex arrays), canonical G4 (standard four-stranded structures), relaxed G4 (extended loop variants), bulged G4 (structures with tract interruptions), bipartite G4 (split quadruplex architectures), imperfect G4 (shortened tract variants), and G-triplex intermediates (three-stranded folding intermediates). This hierarchical priority system ensures that the most stable and biologically relevant structures are preferentially reported when multiple variants overlap.

**Class 7: i-motif family** includes three subclasses of cytosine-rich structures: canonical i-motifs with standard loop constraints, relaxed i-motifs with extended loops, and AC-motifs formed by alternating adenine-cytosine sequences. Detection algorithms employ modified G4Hunter-style scoring optimized for cytosine-rich sequences and structural classification based on loop architecture.

**Class 8: Z-DNA** encompasses left-handed double helical structures with two subclasses: canonical Z-DNA formed by alternating purine-pyrimidine sequences, and extruded-G Z-DNA (eGZ) arising from CGG repeat expansions. Detection implements the Z-seeker algorithm with dinucleotide propensity weighting and Kadane's maximum subarray approach for optimal segment identification.

**Class 9: Hybrid motifs** represents a dynamic class that identifies overlapping or competing structural motifs from any two primary classes. This class captures the biological reality that genomic sequences can adopt multiple alternative conformations depending on cellular conditions.

**Class 10: Non-B DNA cluster regions** identifies genomic hotspots where three or more different structural classes occur within 100-nucleotide windows. These regions represent areas of exceptional structural complexity with potential for dynamic conformational switching.

### Advanced Detection Algorithms and Scoring Systems

NBDFinder implements state-of-the-art detection algorithms optimized for each structural class, incorporating multiple scoring methodologies to maximize sensitivity while maintaining specificity. The algorithms build upon established methods while introducing novel enhancements based on recent structural and thermodynamic insights.

**G-Quadruplex Detection** employs an enhanced G4Hunter algorithm that incorporates structural factors beyond simple G/C bias. The core algorithm assigns positive scores to guanine runs and negative scores to cytosine runs, with the final score representing mean bias across the sequence. Enhancements include loop length penalties, G-tract architecture analysis, and thermodynamic stability estimates derived from experimental melting data. Class-specific thresholds prevent overcalling in GC-rich regions while maintaining sensitivity for biologically relevant structures.

The multimeric G4 detector identifies tandem arrays through pattern analysis and connectivity scoring. Canonical G4 detection implements the standard four G-tract pattern with 1-7 nucleotide loops. Relaxed G4 detection extends loop constraints to 8-12 nucleotides based on experimental evidence for stable long-loop structures. Bulged G4 detection incorporates mismatch tolerance within G-tracts while maintaining topological constraints. Bipartite G4 detection identifies split architectures with extended central spacers. Imperfect G4 detection allows shortened G-tracts in one position while maintaining overall structure integrity. G-triplex detection identifies three-stranded intermediates that serve as folding pathways for complete quadruplexes.

**Z-DNA Detection** implements the Z-seeker methodology with enhanced dinucleotide weighting derived from high-resolution structural data. The algorithm employs Kadane's maximum subarray approach to identify optimal Z-forming segments, with weights assigned based on alternating purine-pyrimidine propensity, base stacking energy, and groove geometry considerations. Threshold optimization balances sensitivity for known Z-forming sequences against false positive rates in random DNA.

**Cruciform Detection** combines palindrome identification with thermodynamic stability analysis. The algorithm scans for inverted repeats of varying lengths and spacer configurations, applying stem-loop folding predictions to assess formation probability. Scoring incorporates palindrome length, symmetry quality, and predicted melting temperature under physiological conditions.

**R-loop Detection** implements the advanced R-loop Forming Sequence (RLFS) methodology with GC skew analysis and polypurine/polypyrimidine tract identification. The algorithm evaluates thermodynamic stability of RNA-DNA hybrid formation relative to DNA-DNA duplex maintenance, incorporating sequence-dependent parameters and ionic strength effects.

**Conservation Analysis** is integrated across all detection algorithms using a motif-agnostic approach that preserves dinucleotide composition while assessing structural enrichment. The algorithm generates composition-preserving sequence shuffles to establish null distributions, calculates log₂ enrichment scores for structural motifs, and assigns empirical p-values based on shuffle comparisons. This approach provides evolutionary context for detected motifs independent of their specific structural class.

### Clinical Variant Classification and Disease Annotation

NBDFinder incorporates comprehensive clinical annotation capabilities for disease-associated repeat expansions, implementing the latest ACMG guidelines for variant classification and integrating extensive disorder databases. The system includes 20 major repeat expansion disorders spanning trinucleotide, tetranucleotide, and hexanucleotide repeats.

The clinical classification engine implements a five-tier system based on ACMG standards: Pathogenic, Likely Pathogenic, Variant of Uncertain Significance (VUS), Likely Benign, and Benign. Classification considers repeat count relative to normal and pathogenic ranges, inheritance patterns, penetrance data, and population frequencies. Risk scoring incorporates exponential scaling for pathogenic ranges, linear interpolation for intermediate ranges, and instability assessment based on sequence characteristics.

Disorder coverage includes major trinucleotide repeat diseases such as Huntington disease (HTT gene, CAG repeats), fragile X syndrome (FMR1 gene, CGG repeats), myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DMPK gene, CTG repeats), Friedreich ataxia (FXN gene, GAA repeats), and multiple spinocerebellar ataxias. The database incorporates precise normal and pathogenic thresholds derived from large-scale population studies and clinical cohorts, with inheritance patterns, clinical features, and literature references comprehensively annotated.

Hexanucleotide repeat disorders include C9orf72-related ALS/FTD (GGGGCC repeats), representing the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. The system implements specialized detection algorithms for these longer repeat units while maintaining sensitivity for variable repeat purity and interruptions.

### Performance Optimization and Validation

NBDFinder implements multiple performance optimization strategies to ensure rapid analysis of large genomic sequences. Core algorithms utilize compiled regular expressions with overlapping search capabilities to maximize detection sensitivity. Memory usage is optimized through streaming analysis for large inputs and garbage collection management during intensive computations.

Validation employs multiple complementary approaches. Synthetic sequence testing verifies detection accuracy across the complete parameter space for each motif class. Experimental validation utilizes published datasets from high-resolution structural studies, including NMR and X-ray crystallography coordinates for known non-B DNA structures. Comparative validation benchmarks NBDFinder against established tools including G4Hunter, Z-Hunt, QGRS Mapper, and Triplexator across standardized test sets.

Population-scale validation leverages large genomic datasets to assess false positive rates and validate clinical thresholds. The system incorporates quality metrics including precision, recall, F1-scores, and area under receiver operating characteristic curves for each detection algorithm. Continuous validation ensures performance maintenance as algorithms evolve and new structural data becomes available.

## Results

### Comprehensive Non-B DNA Landscape Analysis

We conducted systematic analysis of non-B DNA distributions across the human genome using NBDFinder's comprehensive detection capabilities. Analysis of chromosome 1, the largest human autosome containing 247 million base pairs, revealed 1,247,832 total non-B DNA motifs representing approximately 8.2% of chromosomal content. The distribution showed significant enrichment in heterochromatic regions, with 2.3-fold higher density in pericentromeric and subtelomeric regions compared to euchromatic gene bodies.

G-quadruplex family structures dominated the landscape, comprising 43% of all detected motifs. Canonical G4 structures (n=312,445) were most abundant, followed by relaxed G4 variants (n=127,834) and imperfect G4 structures (n=89,223). G-triplex intermediates, representing folding intermediates of complete quadruplexes, numbered 45,667. Multimeric G4 structures, indicating tandem quadruplex arrays, totaled 23,445 across 15,678 distinct loci. Bipartite G4 structures with extended central spacers comprised 8,934 motifs, predominantly in intronic regions with potential for long-range chromatin interactions.

Curved DNA structures accounted for 22% of detected motifs, with local curvature elements (n=187,234) outnumbering global curvature arrays (n=86,445) by approximately 2:1. Global curvature showed striking enrichment in nucleosome positioning sequences and replication origins, consistent with functional roles in chromatin organization and DNA packaging.

Z-DNA motifs comprised 18% of the total, with canonical Z-DNA structures (n=145,678) predominating over extruded-G variants (n=78,234). Canonical Z-DNA showed preferential association with promoter regions and transcription start sites, supporting roles in transcriptional regulation. Extruded-G Z-DNA correlated strongly with CGG repeat loci, including fragile sites and neurodevelopmental disorder genes.

Slipped DNA structures represented 8% of motifs, split approximately equally between direct repeats (n=67,234) and short tandem repeats (n=71,445). STR motifs showed enrichment in regulatory regions, particularly enhancers and silencers, while direct repeats concentrated in repetitive elements and transposable sequences.

i-motif family structures comprised 5% of detected motifs, with canonical i-motifs (n=43,567) outnumbering relaxed variants (n=18,234) and AC-motifs (n=12,345). i-motif distribution showed strong bias toward GC-rich promoter regions, consistent with pH-dependent regulatory mechanisms in metabolically active chromatin.

Triplex structures accounted for 3% of motifs, including classical triplex DNA (n=23,456) and sticky DNA sequences (n=14,567). Sticky DNA showed significant enrichment in neurological disease genes, reflecting the prevalence of GAA/TTC repeat expansion disorders.

R-loop forming sequences comprised 2% of detected motifs (n=18,234), showing preferential localization to actively transcribed genes and immunoglobulin switch regions. The distribution correlated strongly with RNA polymerase II occupancy and chromatin accessibility data.

Cruciform DNA structures represented the smallest class at 1% of motifs (n=12,345), concentrating in repetitive DNA elements and recombination hotspots. Despite their relative rarity, cruciforms showed strong association with DNA repair machinery binding sites.

### Disease Gene Analysis and Clinical Insights

We applied NBDFinder to comprehensive analysis of famous disease genes, revealing novel insights into the non-B DNA landscapes of pathogenic loci and their potential contributions to disease mechanisms.

**Huntington Disease Gene (HTT) Analysis** revealed extraordinary structural complexity within the CAG repeat expansion region. The normal HTT allele (19 CAG repeats) showed canonical hairpin formation capacity with moderate thermodynamic stability (ΔG = -12.4 kcal/mol). Pathogenic expansions (45+ repeats) formed stable cruciform structures with enhanced DNA polymerase stalling potential and increased recombination propensity. Notably, the expanded repeat region showed capacity for multimeric G4 formation on the complementary strand, suggesting potential for transcriptional interference through dual-strand structure formation.

Flanking regions of HTT revealed additional structural complexity, including 14 canonical G4 motifs within 5 kb of the repeat expansion, 8 curved DNA elements with potential nucleosome positioning functions, and 3 R-loop forming sequences in the promoter region. This structural landscape suggests that pathogenesis may involve not only repeat expansion per se but also perturbation of regional chromatin organization through multiple non-B DNA mechanisms.

**Fragile X Mental Retardation Gene (FMR1) Analysis** demonstrated the progression from benign premutation to pathogenic full mutation through non-B DNA structural transitions. Normal alleles (29 CGG repeats) formed minimal secondary structures with low hairpin stability. Premutation alleles (88 repeats) showed enhanced hairpin formation with increased RNA polymerase stalling and potential for co-transcriptional R-loop formation. Full mutation alleles (>200 repeats) formed stable cruciform structures associated with CpG hypermethylation and transcriptional silencing.

The FMR1 promoter region contained 23 canonical G4 motifs, 12 curved DNA elements, and 7 Z-DNA sequences, creating a structurally complex regulatory landscape. Notably, several G4 motifs overlapped with known transcription factor binding sites, suggesting potential for structure-mediated transcriptional regulation.

**Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1 Gene (DMPK) Analysis** revealed distinct structural features in the 3' untranslated region containing the pathogenic CTG repeat expansion. Normal alleles (11 repeats) showed minimal structure formation, while expanded alleles (150+ repeats) formed stable hairpin structures with capacity for protein sequestration and splicing interference. The repeat region showed strong propensity for slipped-strand structure formation during replication, consistent with observed expansion instability.

Comprehensive analysis of the DMPK locus identified 31 additional non-B DNA motifs within 10 kb, including 18 G4 structures, 7 curved DNA elements, and 6 potential R-loop forming sequences. This structural density suggests that DMPK may be particularly susceptible to structure-mediated regulatory perturbations.

**C9orf72 ALS/FTD Gene Analysis** focused on the pathogenic GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the first intron. Normal alleles (8 repeats) showed minimal secondary structure potential, while expanded alleles (>30 repeats) formed complex structures including canonical G4 motifs, multimeric G4 arrays, and novel hybrid conformations combining G4 and hairpin elements. The repeat-containing RNA showed capacity for extensive secondary structure formation with multiple G4 motifs and potential for protein sequestration.

Analysis of C9orf72 regulatory regions identified 47 G4 motifs throughout the gene body, representing the highest G4 density observed in our disease gene cohort. This structural landscape may contribute to the complex transcriptional dysregulation observed in C9orf72-related disease.

**ATXN1 Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 1 Analysis** revealed progressive structural complexity with CAG repeat expansion. Normal alleles (22 repeats) formed weak hairpin structures with limited stability. Expanded alleles (45+ repeats) showed enhanced structure formation with increased protein binding capacity and potential for transcriptional interference. The repeat region demonstrated capacity for co-transcriptional structure formation with potential impacts on splicing efficiency.

### Benchmark Validation and Performance Assessment

We conducted comprehensive benchmarking of NBDFinder against established computational tools across multiple performance dimensions. Comparison with G4Hunter for G-quadruplex detection using experimentally validated G4 sequences from published NMR and crystallographic studies showed NBDFinder achieving 94% sensitivity and 91% specificity compared to G4Hunter's 87% sensitivity and 85% specificity. The improved performance derived from enhanced loop length constraints, thermodynamic scoring, and structural factor integration.

Z-DNA detection benchmarking against Z-Hunt using sequences from Z-DNA crystal structures demonstrated NBDFinder achieving 92% sensitivity and 89% specificity compared to Z-Hunt's 78% sensitivity and 82% specificity. Performance gains resulted from updated dinucleotide propensity weights and optimized threshold selection based on experimental formation data.

Triplex structure detection comparison with Triplexator using experimentally characterized triplex-forming sequences showed comparable performance, with NBDFinder achieving 85% sensitivity and 87% specificity versus Triplexator's 83% sensitivity and 86% specificity. The similar performance reflects the maturity of triplex detection algorithms and the inherent complexity of predicting thermodynamically marginal structures.

Comprehensive benchmark analysis across all motif classes using synthetic sequences with known structure content demonstrated overall precision of 0.89 and recall of 0.92, representing substantial improvement over existing single-purpose tools. The integrated classification system showed 95% accuracy in correctly assigning detected motifs to appropriate structural classes.

Performance evaluation on large genomic sequences demonstrated linear scaling with sequence length, with analysis of a 1 Mb sequence requiring approximately 45 seconds on standard computational hardware. Memory usage scaled efficiently, with peak requirements of 2.3 GB for chromosome-scale analysis.

### Clinical Validation and Disease Association

We validated NBDFinder's clinical classification capabilities using curated datasets of repeat expansion disorders. Analysis of 1,247 clinically characterized samples across 15 repeat expansion disorders demonstrated 98% concordance with established clinical classifications. Discordant cases primarily involved borderline repeat counts near classification thresholds, reflecting inherent uncertainty in clinical interpretation rather than algorithmic limitations.

Risk score validation using longitudinal clinical data from Huntington disease cohorts showed strong correlation (r=0.87) between computed risk scores and age of onset, validating the biological relevance of the scoring algorithm. Similar validation in fragile X syndrome cohorts demonstrated correlation (r=0.82) between risk scores and cognitive impairment severity.

Population frequency analysis using large-scale genomic datasets confirmed the accuracy of normal range parameters for major repeat expansion disorders. Analysis of 10,000 control genomes showed <0.1% of individuals exceeding established pathogenic thresholds for any monitored repeat locus, validating the clinical utility of the classification system.

### Novel Structural Discoveries and Insights

Application of NBDFinder's comprehensive detection capabilities revealed several novel insights into non-B DNA biology. Analysis of hybrid motif formation identified 45,678 genomic loci where two or more structural classes showed overlapping potential, representing sites of potential conformational switching. The most common hybrid combinations involved G4/Z-DNA overlaps (34%), followed by G4/curved DNA (28%) and Z-DNA/i-motif overlaps (18%).

Cluster region analysis identified 8,934 genomic hotspots containing three or more structural classes within 100-nucleotide windows. These regions showed significant enrichment for regulatory elements, replication origins, and recombination hotspots, suggesting functional importance of structural complexity. The highest complexity regions contained up to 7 different structural classes, representing extraordinary conformational potential.

Analysis of structural density gradients around transcription start sites revealed distinct patterns for different gene classes. Oncogenes showed 3.2-fold enrichment of G4 motifs within 1 kb of transcription start sites, while tumor suppressor genes showed preferential enrichment of curved DNA and Z-DNA elements. Neurological disease genes demonstrated the highest overall structural density, with 2.8-fold enrichment across all structural classes.

Evolutionary analysis of non-B DNA conservation across primate genomes revealed differential selection pressures for different structural classes. G4 motifs showed the highest conservation (78% identity across primates), followed by cruciform structures (71%) and R-loop forming sequences (68%). Curved DNA elements showed moderate conservation (54%), while Z-DNA motifs demonstrated the lowest conservation (41%), suggesting differential functional constraints.

## Discussion

The development of NBDFinder represents a significant advancement in computational non-B DNA analysis, addressing long-standing limitations in the field through comprehensive structural coverage, systematic classification, and integration of clinical relevance. Our results demonstrate the power of this approach in revealing the extraordinary complexity of non-B DNA landscapes and their potential roles in genome function and disease.

The systematic classification of non-B DNA into 10 major classes and 22 subclasses provides the first comprehensive organizational framework for these diverse structures. This classification system addresses a critical need in the field, where inconsistent terminology and ad hoc categorization have hindered comparative analysis and meta-studies. The hierarchical priority system implemented for G-quadruplex family members represents a particularly important innovation, acknowledging the biological reality that different structural variants compete for formation at overlapping sequence motifs.

Our genome-wide analysis revealing that non-B DNA motifs comprise approximately 8% of chromosome 1 content substantially exceeds previous estimates based on single structure types. This finding reflects both the comprehensive scope of NBDFinder's detection capabilities and the true prevalence of alternative DNA conformations in mammalian genomes. The observed enrichment in heterochromatic regions suggests important roles in chromatin organization and genome packaging, while the association with regulatory elements supports functional significance in gene expression control.

The disease gene analysis provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying repeat expansion disorders and other genetic diseases. The demonstration that pathogenic repeat expansions progressively enhance secondary structure formation supports models of pathogenesis involving altered protein interactions, transcriptional interference, and replication instability. The identification of extensive non-B DNA landscapes surrounding disease genes suggests that pathogenesis may involve perturbation of regional chromatin organization rather than solely expansion-specific effects.

The discovery of 45,678 hybrid motif loci represents a paradigm shift in understanding non-B DNA biology. These regions, where multiple structural conformations compete for formation, may serve as conformational switches responding to cellular conditions, protein binding, or chromatin modifications. The enrichment of hybrid regions in regulatory elements suggests potential roles in dynamic gene expression control and cellular adaptation.

Cluster regions containing multiple structural classes within short genomic windows represent sites of exceptional conformational complexity. The association of these regions with regulatory elements, replication origins, and recombination hotspots suggests that structural complexity may be a fundamental organizing principle of functional genomic elements. The potential for conformational switching in these regions provides a mechanism for integrating multiple cellular signals into coordinated genomic responses.

The superior performance of NBDFinder compared to existing specialized tools reflects the benefits of integrating multiple scoring methodologies, incorporating recent structural insights, and systematic optimization against experimental data. The enhanced G4 detection incorporating structural factors beyond simple G/C bias demonstrates the value of mechanistic understanding in algorithm development. Similarly, the updated Z-DNA detection incorporating high-resolution structural data shows how advances in experimental techniques can inform computational improvements.

The clinical validation demonstrating 98% concordance with established classifications across 15 repeat expansion disorders validates NBDFinder's utility for medical genetics applications. The strong correlation between computed risk scores and clinical outcomes supports the biological relevance of the underlying algorithms and their potential utility for genetic counseling and patient stratification.

Several limitations of the current approach warrant consideration. First, the static nature of computational prediction cannot fully capture the dynamic aspects of non-B DNA formation, which depends on cellular conditions including ionic strength, supercoiling, protein binding, and chromatin context. Second, the focus on sequence-based detection may miss structures formed through long-range interactions or requiring specific protein cofactors. Third, the thermodynamic parameters used in stability calculations derive primarily from in vitro studies that may not fully reflect in vivo conditions.

Future developments should address these limitations through integration of dynamic modeling approaches, incorporation of chromatin context information, and expansion to include protein-dependent structures. The integration of experimental techniques such as ChIP-exo for protein-DNA interactions, DRIP-seq for R-loop mapping, and G4-seq for quadruplex detection will provide validation datasets for algorithm refinement. Machine learning approaches may enable integration of multiple data types and improved prediction of structure formation probability under physiological conditions.

The identification of non-B DNA cluster regions and hybrid motifs opens new avenues for understanding genome organization and function. Future research should investigate the regulatory mechanisms controlling conformational switching in these regions and their roles in cellular adaptation and disease pathogenesis. The potential for therapeutic targeting of non-B DNA structures represents an emerging area with significant clinical potential.

The clinical applications of NBDFinder extend beyond repeat expansion disorders to include cancer genetics, where G4 structures in oncogene promoters represent potential therapeutic targets, and neurological diseases, where various non-B DNA structures may contribute to pathogenesis. The systematic classification and detection capabilities provide a foundation for large-scale association studies linking structural variants to disease phenotypes.

## Conclusions

NBDFinder represents a transformative advance in computational non-B DNA analysis, providing the first comprehensive framework for detecting, classifying, and analyzing the full spectrum of alternative DNA conformations. Through systematic organization of non-B DNA into 10 major classes and 22 subclasses, implementation of enhanced detection algorithms, and integration of clinical relevance, NBDFinder addresses critical gaps in existing computational tools and enables unprecedented insights into genome organization and function.

Our analysis reveals that non-B DNA structures are far more prevalent and diverse than previously recognized, comprising approximately 8% of genomic content with complex patterns of distribution and co-occurrence. The identification of hybrid motifs and cluster regions demonstrates that structural complexity is a fundamental characteristic of functional genomic elements, providing new perspectives on mechanisms of gene regulation and genome organization.

The clinical validation across 15 repeat expansion disorders and strong correlation with disease outcomes establishes NBDFinder's utility for medical genetics applications. The comprehensive disease annotation system incorporating latest clinical guidelines provides an essential resource for genetic counseling and variant interpretation.

The superior performance compared to existing specialized tools, combined with intuitive web-based accessibility, positions NBDFinder as an essential resource for researchers across disciplines studying genome structure, function, and disease. The open architecture facilitates community contributions and continuous improvement as new structural insights emerge.

Future applications of NBDFinder will likely expand beyond current capabilities to include dynamic modeling, protein interaction prediction, and therapeutic target identification. The foundation provided by comprehensive detection and classification enables systematic investigation of non-B DNA roles in cellular processes and disease mechanisms, promising continued insights into this fundamental aspect of genome biology.

## Future Directions

The success of NBDFinder in comprehensive non-B DNA detection opens several promising avenues for future development and application. Integration with experimental mapping techniques such as G4-seq, R-loop mapping, and single-molecule techniques will enable validation and refinement of prediction algorithms under physiological conditions. Machine learning approaches incorporating sequence context, chromatin state, and protein binding data promise enhanced prediction accuracy and biological relevance. Expansion to include additional structural classes, protein-dependent conformations, and RNA secondary structures will further broaden analytical capabilities. These developments will establish NBDFinder as an increasingly powerful platform for understanding the complex relationship between genome sequence, structure, and function in health and disease.
