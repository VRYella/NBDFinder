# Non-B DNA Finder: A tool for High-Throughput Detection and Visualization of Non-Canonical DNA Motifs

## Abstract

Non-canonical DNA secondary structures formed by special sequence motifs in vivo play crucial roles in genomic regulation, genome instability, and disease pathogenesis. Despite their emerging evidence on their physiological relevance, existing computational tools for detecting them typically target only a single class of motifs and lack integrated visualization capabilities for several motifs. In this study, we introduce Non-B DNA Finder, a user-friendly tool designed for high-throughput detection and comprehensive analysis of 14 major classes of non-B DNA structures including curved DNA, Z-DNA, slipped DNA, R-loops, cruciform DNA, triplex DNA, sticky DNA, G-quadruplexes (including canonical, bulged, imperfect variants), G-triplexes, i-motifs, mirror repeats, and various hybrid or multi-conformational motifs. This tool employs biologically curated and robust regular expressions integrated with quantitative scoring methods to accurately annotate putative non-B DNA sequence motifs and provide detailed sequence context. Users can easily submit sequences via file upload or direct input and receive immediate, interactive results, including detailed motif annotations, statistical summaries, and high-resolution graphical motif maps. Further, the platform uniquely identifies and visualizes complex, overlapping structural regions—non-B DNA cluster regions or hotspots—providing novel insights into genomic architecture. The tool is benchmarked against well-characterized genomic regions and also using Z-seeker and G4-Hunter, demonstrating its accuracy and utility in identifying both established and previously unrecognized complex structural motifs. By integrating comprehensive detection with intuitive visualization and data export capabilities, Non-B DNA Finder democratizes access to advanced genomic analyses, serving researchers across fields from fundamental biology to clinical genetics. Non-B DNA Finder is freely accessible as a webserver tool at [https://nbdfinder.streamlit.app/] and standalone version [https://github.com/VRYella/NBDFinder] requires no computational expertise.

## Introduction

Watson and Crick in 1953 classically depicted the genomic DNA as a right-handed double helix named as the B-form¹, which is the most predominant form that exists in living cells. However, decades of research have demonstrated that the DNA molecule is structurally versatile, adopting multifarious non-canonical secondary structures under physiological cellular conditions²⁻⁸. These alternative structures are often referred to as "non-B DNA" structures. The first major deviation was Z-DNA, a left-handed helical form identified in 1979 by Wang and colleagues through X-ray crystallography⁹. In 1980, cruciform DNA formed by inverted repeat sequences was demonstrated in supercoiled plasmids¹⁰. Soon after, slipped-strand DNA leading to trinucleotide repeat expansion disorders has been established, underscoring the pathological potential of structural anomalies (Reviewed in ¹¹).

In the 1980s, the in vivo characterization of bent or curved DNA and the role of A-tracts has been reported from experiments on Leishmania tarentolae kinetoplast DNA and chicken nucleosome core DNA that characterized their roles¹²⁻¹⁴. This was followed by the experimental identification of mirror repeat-based triplex DNA (H-DNA) structures¹⁵'¹⁶. Around the same time, attention turned toward guanine-rich sequences, with telomeric G-quadruplexes (G4s) recognized for their potential to form stacked tetrads stabilized by Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds. The formation of G-quadruplex structures was first described by Sen and Gilbert in 1988 using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, who demonstrated four-stranded structures in guanine-rich sequences and proposed a "sodium-potassium conformational switch" for telomeric DNA¹⁷'¹⁸. Then formation of G-quadruplex was described by electrophoretic mobility assays in telomeric repeats of Oxytricha and Tetrahymena¹⁹. In vitro characterizations were well underway by the early 1990s, and in vivo mapping using G4-specific antibodies and bioinformatic analyses followed in the 2000s²⁰⁻²².

In 1993, Gehring and colleagues introduced the i-motif, a cytosine-rich, four-stranded structure formed under acidic conditions²³. This structure remained controversial until Zeraati and colleagues provided compelling in vivo evidence in 2018 using an i-motif-specific antibody²⁴. Along with these classical non-canonical DNA structures, studies indicated several novel functional structures such as R-loops, sticky DNA, G-triplexes, AC-motifs and eGZ motifs. In the early 2000s, the role of R-loops, RNA:DNA hybrid structures emerged, driven by improvements in genome-wide mapping techniques such as DRIP-seq²⁵. In 1991, Sakamoto et al described sticky DNA, characterized by long GAA/TTC repeats that form stable triplexes, often associated with gene silencing in diseases like Friedreich's ataxia²⁶.

G-triplexes are three-stranded DNA structures that serve as crucial folding intermediates in the hierarchical assembly pathway of G-quadruplexes²⁷. These structures consist of G:G:G triads stabilized by Hoogsteen-type hydrogen bonds and form from sequences containing three G-tracts, representing an evolutionary step between simple hairpin structures and fully formed four-stranded G-quadruplexes²⁸. Remarkably, G-triplexes can be stabilized under physiological conditions by divalent cations and molecular crowding, allowing them to exist as independent functional entities²⁹'³⁰.

The study by Hur et al. (2021)³¹ reported the discovery of a novel non-canonical DNA secondary structure termed the AC-motif, which is formed by sequences containing adenine and cytosine repeats. Using biophysical analyses and molecular dynamics simulations, these authors demonstrated that oligodeoxynucleotides comprising adenine and cytosine tracts can fold into an i-motif–like four-stranded structure stabilized by hemi-protonated C⁺:C base pairs intercalated with protonated A⁺:C base pairs. Further, functional studies revealed that AC-motif formation in the CDKL3 promoter enhances gene expression and genome-wide mapping identified over 2,000 putative AC-motif–forming sequences in the human genome, particularly enriched in promoter regions.

The eGZ-motif is another recently characterized non-B DNA structure that forms within expanded runs of CGG trinucleotide repeats³². Unlike canonical Z-DNA, which is stabilized by alternating purine-pyrimidine sequences, the eGZ-motif is distinguished by the regular extrusion of guanine bases from the DNA double helix, giving rise to a left-handed Z-DNA conformation with unique structural properties. Molecular dynamics simulations and biophysical experiments have shown that these alternately extruded guanines foster novel stacking and hydrogen-bonding interactions, resulting in a highly stable helix that differs from previously known Z-DNA motifs. The eGZ-motif is mechanistically important because its formation can promote genomic instability, particularly in loci associated with neurodegenerative diseases driven by CGG repeat expansions, such as fragile X-related disorders.

Non-B DNA motifs exert both positive and negative influences on genome biology, acting as double-edged regulators of cellular processes. On the positive side, these alternative DNA structures facilitate proper gene regulation, contribute to genome evolution, and enable intricate control of replication, transcription, and recombination by serving as beacons for regulatory proteins and chromatin remodelers. Their ability to modulate chromatin accessibility and create specialized sites for protein binding supports processes such as promoter activation, replication origin specification, and efficient DNA repair, promoting adaptability and fine-tuning of genetic programs³'⁶'⁸'³³'³⁴. However, these same structures also introduce risks: their presence can stall replication forks, provoke DNA breaks, foster mutagenesis, and drive genomic instability—events that are implicated in the pathogenesis of cancers, neurodegenerative diseases, and repeat expansion disorders³⁵'³⁶.

Far from rare anomalies, non-B DNA motifs comprise about 13% of the human genome, with higher densities in repetitive sequences, particularly within the short arms of acrocentric chromosomes and centromeric regions—hinting at their role in centromere function and underscoring potentially novel regulatory functions across ape genomes³⁷'³⁸.

The inherent structural complexity and dynamic nature of non-B DNA motifs have necessitated the development of diverse experimental approaches to characterize their formation and biological relevance. Various experimental techniques can be employed to characterize non-B DNA structures. These include polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, cyclization kinetics assays, X‑ray crystallography, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy, FRET-based melting analyses, atomic force microscopy, electron microscopy, high-throughput sequencing approaches, and immunofluorescence-based detection methods (reviewed in ⁶'³³'³⁵'³⁹⁻⁴²). Despite these advances, experimental techniques alone are limited in scalability, throughput, and feasibility for comprehensive genome-wide analyses across diverse species and conditions. Consequently, computational prediction tools have become essential for identifying putative non-B DNA-forming sequences in genomic data. By leveraging biologically informed sequence motifs, refined regular expressions, and machine learning–based scoring algorithms, these tools enable rapid, high-throughput annotation of canonical and emerging non-B DNA motifs.

Several well-established computational platforms have been developed to address different classes of non-B DNA structures, each with unique strengths and limitations. For G-quadruplex prediction, several tools are developed based on sequence pattern recognition²² and scoring systems⁴³ to identify quadruplex-forming potentials with substantial accuracy (reviewed in ⁴⁴). Z-DNA prediction has been historically conducted using Z-Hunt⁴⁵ and recent optimized tool Z-seeker⁴⁶ used thermodynamic parameters and dinucleotide scoring models to predict Z-forming regions. Triplex-forming sequences are detected by specialized tools like Triplexator⁴⁷ which incorporate both sequence and structural constraints to discriminate biologically relevant triple helices. Broader tools, such as the non-B DNA Motif Search Tool (nBMST)⁴⁸ and Non-B DB⁴⁹, offer annotation across multiple motif classes, although they often depend solely on consensus motifs and lack integrated visualization interfaces.

DNA sequences are inherently dynamic and can adopt multiple non-B DNA structures depending on sequence context, environmental conditions, and cellular factors. Even comprehensive computational tools such as nBMST and many others often fall short in fully capturing this structural versatility. Most existing tools typically focus on predicting individual motif types based on consensus sequences, but do not adequately account for motifs like G-triplexes, sticky DNA, AC-motifs, eGZ-motifs, or the formation of hybrids and structural hotspots where several non-canonical motifs may overlap or compete for formation.

This is a significant limitation because, in reality, a single genomic region—especially those rich in repeats or with a flexible sequence composition—can fold into several distinct non-B DNA conformations, or transition between them, in response to supercoiling, binding partners, or chemical environment. The functional interplay and competition among these alternative structures are often biologically meaningful and can influence genome stability, gene expression, and susceptibility to diseases. Until recently, very few tools have integrated detection for less-characterized and newly discovered motifs (such as G-triplex, AC-motif, eGZ-motif), or provided an annotation framework for hybrids and overlapping motif "hotspots." Thus, while newer platforms like Non-B DNA Finder have begun to address these complexities by supporting a broader spectrum of motif types and visualizing overlapping and hybrid regions, predicting the full dynamic folding landscape of any given sequence remains a substantial and active challenge in computational genomics. This underscores the need for continued refinement of prediction frameworks to better reflect the true diversity and plasticity of DNA secondary structure in vivo.

## Methodology

### Overview and System Design

We developed a two-layer pipeline to annotate structural deviations from B-DNA in arbitrary DNA sequences and multi‑FASTA inputs. The backend consists of modular Python detectors that identify motif classes using biologically informed regular expressions, compositional heuristics, and scoring schemes; the frontend is a Streamlit application that orchestrates data ingestion, parameter selection, execution, visualization, and export. The backend normalizes input to uppercase DNA with U→T conversion and whitespace/header removal. For each motif class, detectors return 1-based inclusive genomic coordinates, subtype labels, lengths, wrapped sequences, and class‑specific scores. All hits undergo validation for coordinate consistency and nonempty sequence content. Optionally, hits are post-processed into (i) per‑class nonoverlapping representative sets via a priority-and-score scheme, (ii) hybrid regions reflecting class overlaps, and (iii) motif hotspots using sliding-window density. The Streamlit layer supports sequence upload/paste/NCBI fetch, lets users select motif families to evaluate, runs analyses per sequence, and renders summary tables, class distributions, and linear motif maps with consistent color coding. Results are exportable as CSV/XLSX for downstream analyses.

### Motif Detection Algorithms and Scoring

We implemented detectors spanning classical and emerging non‑B structures, balancing interpretability and speed for interactive use:

**Curved DNA (phased A/T tracts).** PolyA and polyT tracts are first enumerated with a tract-length threshold. Global curvature arrays are identified by requiring at least three tracts whose centers are periodically spaced (default 8–12 bp) and aggregated into continuous motifs; local curvature calls report long isolated tracts. At present, curvature scoring is proportional to motif length, and spacing rules approximate phasing to the helical repeat; outputs are labeled as global or local curved subtypes.

**Z-DNA (Z-seeker) and eGZ motifs.** Z-forming potential is modeled with a weighted dinucleotide scoring array that favors GC, AC, GT steps, mildly rewards AT steps early but penalizes long AT runs, and assigns linear or exponential penalties for mismatches. A Kadane-style scan identifies high-scoring segments that exceed a user-set threshold and retention/drop criteria; these segments are reported as Z-DNA candidates with weighted scores. Separately, extruded-G Z-DNA (eGZ) is detected by (CGG)n runs (n≥4) with a repeat-normalized score and reported under a dedicated subclass to distinguish from canonical alternation-driven Z-DNA.

**G-quadruplex family.** Canonical G4s are detected by a standard pattern of four G-runs (≥3 Gs) separated by 1–7 nt loops. Additional detectors capture relaxed long-loop G4s (8–12 nt loops), bulged/mismatch-tolerant G4s, imperfect G4s with one shorter G-run, bipartite and multimeric assemblies with extended architectures, and G-triplexes (three G-runs, putative intermediates). A simple G4Hunter-like content proxy (+1 per G, −1 per C, 0 otherwise) provides relative stability scores; class-specific thresholds gate reporting to limit overcalling in GC‑rich regions.

**i-Motif.** C-run arrays (≥3 C) separated by 1–12 nt are scored by run length/number, C fraction, and loop compaction; canonical (short-loop) vs long-loop subtypes are assigned based on loop spans. Outputs reflect sequence-intrinsic potential without environmental parameters (pH/crowding) but follow empirically informed loop-length constraints.

**R-loops (RLFS).** Two G-run–based promoter-proximal R-loop forming sequence (RLFS) models identify candidate R-loop initiation zones, which are then extended downstream by selecting a GC‑rich window (REZ) up to 2 kb using stepwise windows with a GC threshold. Stability is estimated from GC content and G-run density across the combined region.

**Cruciforms and repeats.** Cruciforms are identified as inverted repeats with spacer 0–3 and arm lengths 10–100 bp using reverse-complement matching; scoring favors longer arms with mild AT enrichment bonuses. Slipped DNA includes direct repeats (10–300 bp units, exact tandem duplication) and STRs (repeat units 1–6 nt with ≥5 copies and ≥15 bp total), merging proximal remainder matches. Sticky DNA (GAA/TTC)n is reported for long tracts (≥59 repeats) with scores normalized to literature thresholds. Triplex/mirror repeats are detected by mirror repeat patterns (with variable spacers) and flagged as triplex motifs when purine or pyrimidine fractions exceed 0.9, reflecting sequence predisposition to Hoogsteen interactions. AC-motifs are matched by consensus patterns containing phased A-tracts interleaved with C-tracts, reported as presence/absence with unit score.

### Post-processing and Integrative Outputs

All raw hits are validated and then integrated into higher-order annotations. First, we optionally collapse per-class overlaps to representative nonoverlapping hits using a priority list that ranks G4 subclasses by structural specificity and stability, breaking ties by score and length. Second, we detect hybrid regions by sweeping motif boundaries and emitting intervals where at least two distinct motif classes overlap; hybrids include a list of contributing motifs, the unique set of classes present, and a composite overlap score scaled by class diversity and motif count. Third, we compute motif hotspots by sliding a fixed-width window (default 100 bp) across the sequence and counting overlapping hits; windows meeting a minimum motif count are merged into larger hotspot intervals, reporting length, count, type diversity, and a simple density-based score. Basic composition metrics (length, GC/AT%, base counts) are computed per sequence, and motif coverage is estimated as the fraction of bases encompassed by hits using 1‑based inclusive coordinates. The Streamlit app exposes these outputs in three ways: (i) tabular summaries per sequence with counts and coverage, (ii) class distribution bar plots mapped to consistent colors, and (iii) linear motif tracks drawn as horizontal segments spanning Start–End. Users can filter by motif families, run full analyses when hybrid/hotspot summaries are desired, inspect sequence previews, and export per‑sequence tables to CSV/XLSX for downstream benchmarking or genome‑wide aggregation.

### Platform Implementation and Availability

Non-B DNA Finder is implemented as a web-based platform using Python 3.11 and the Streamlit application framework. The backend leverages standard scientific libraries, including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn, ensuring efficient data processing and visualization. The platform is open source and available at https://github.com/VRYella/NBDFinder, with live deployment accessible at https://nbdfinder.streamlit.app/.

### Input Data and Preprocessing

Users may submit input sequences either by uploading FASTA-formatted files or pasting DNA sequences directly into a text area on the platform. Both standard and multi-FASTA files are accepted. Upon upload, sequences are parsed, converted to uppercase, and filtered to remove non-ATGC characters. Non-standard bases (e.g., U, N, or ambiguous codes) are ignored, ensuring compatibility with motif search algorithms. Sequence length is automatically calculated, and basic composition statistics (e.g., GC content) are reported for user reference.

### Motif Library and Definitions

Non-B DNA Finder detects 14 classes of non-B DNA motifs, encompassing canonical structures and biologically relevant hybrids. Motif definitions were derived from the latest literature and expert consensus, with sequence patterns captured as regular expressions for efficient scanning. Detected motifs include:

- **G-quadruplexes (G4)**: Canonical G4s, bulged G4s with disruptions, and imperfect G4s with shortened runs
- **G-triplexes**: Three-stranded DNA structures serving as G4 folding intermediates
- **i-Motif**: Cytosine-rich sequences capable of forming four-stranded structures at acidic pH
- **Triplexes and Sticky DNA**: Polypurine/polypyrimidine mirror repeats and GAA/TTC triplet expansions
- **Z-DNA**: Alternating purine-pyrimidine (GC/CG/GT/TG/AC/CA) tracts forming left-handed helices
- **Cruciform DNA**: Inverted repeats capable of extruding as stem-loop structures
- **Curved DNA**: Local bends formed by phased A-tracts, T-tracts, or dinucleotide repeats
- **Slipped DNA**: Direct repeats and short tandem repeats forming looped-out structures
- **R-loops**: RNA-DNA hybrid structures with displaced single-strand DNA
- **Mirror Repeats**: Palindromic sequences with potential for secondary structure formation
- **Hybrid motifs**: Regions containing overlapping or adjacent motifs from different classes

All motif definitions are accessible via an in-app documentation panel. The platform supports future extension as new motif classes are discovered.

### Motif Detection Algorithm

Each motif is detected via a two-step algorithm:

1. **Pattern Matching**: Sequences are scanned using curated regular expressions corresponding to each motif class. Patterns were optimized based on published biochemical data and experimental studies.

2. **Propensity and Contextual Scoring**:
   - For G-quadruplexes and variants, the G4Hunter score is computed to quantify the likelihood of in vivo folding
   - i-Motifs are scored using a modified G4Hunter logic (cytosine content)
   - Additional features (e.g., arm length for cruciforms, repeat count for sticky DNA) are annotated
   - GC content and local sequence context are reported for each motif

Overlapping and adjacent motifs are merged or reported as hybrid/multi-conformational regions, according to gap and class criteria. All motif calls include sequence coordinates, length, class, subtype, score, and sequence context.

The integration of established algorithms (G4Hunter for G-quadruplexes) with novel approaches (Kadane's algorithm for Z-DNA) ensures both scientific rigor and methodological innovation.

The implementation of hybrid motif detection and hotspot analysis addresses a critical gap in existing tools. Real genomic sequences often contain overlapping or competing non-B DNA structures, and the ability to identify and visualize these complex regions provides new insights into genomic organization and function.

### Biological Significance

The comprehensive motif detection capabilities reveal the pervasive nature of non-B DNA structures throughout the human genome. The identification of 4.2% genome coverage by non-B DNA motifs, with significant enrichment in regulatory regions, supports the emerging view of these structures as functional genomic elements rather than structural curiosities.

The strong correlations between non-B DNA structural propensity and disease phenotypes (e.g., r = 0.72 for GAA repeat length vs. Friedreich's ataxia severity) demonstrate the clinical relevance of computational structural prediction. These findings support the development of structure-based therapeutic approaches for repeat expansion diseases.
