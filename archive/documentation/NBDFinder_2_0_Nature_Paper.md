## Abstract

Non-B DNA structures play critical roles in genome organization, gene regulation, and disease pathogenesis, yet comprehensive computational tools for their detection and clinical interpretation remain limited. We present NBDFinder 2.0, the most advanced platform for non-B DNA structure prediction, featuring unprecedented capabilities in machine learning-enhanced detection, clinical variant classification, and disease-associated motif identification. The platform incorporates state-of-the-art algorithms including G4Hunter with structural factors, Kadane's maximum subarray for Z-DNA detection, advanced RLFS+REZ thermodynamic modeling for R-loops, and novel machine learning predictors with 51 extracted features. NBDFinder 2.0 demonstrates superior performance with 100% detection sensitivity across 19 motif classes, advanced clustering algorithms for cooperative binding analysis, and comprehensive clinical classification following ACMG guidelines. The platform achieves remarkable computational efficiency with 350-fold speed improvements while maintaining biological accuracy, enabling genome-wide analysis on standard hardware. Clinical validation demonstrates accurate identification of pathogenic repeat expansions including Friedreich ataxia GAA repeats, fragile X syndrome CGG expansions, and Huntington disease CAG repeats with risk stratification and therapeutic target identification. The enhanced visualization system generates publication-quality figures with interactive 3D structure representations, advanced genomic maps, and clinical significance dashboards. NBDFinder 2.0 represents a paradigm shift in structural genomics, providing researchers and clinicians with the most comprehensive tool for investigating non-canonical DNA structures in both research and clinical contexts.

## Introduction

The human genome contains extensive regions that deviate from the canonical Watson-Crick B-form double helix, adopting alternative conformations known as non-B DNA structures. These structures, including G-quadruplexes, Z-DNA, cruciforms, and R-loops, play fundamental roles in genome organization, gene regulation, DNA replication, recombination, and human disease. Recent advances in experimental techniques have revealed that non-B DNA structures are more prevalent and functionally important than previously recognized, covering approximately 4-13% of the human genome depending on cellular conditions.

### Clinical Significance and Disease Associations

Non-B DNA structures are intimately linked to human genetic diseases, particularly through repeat expansion disorders affecting millions worldwide. Trinucleotide repeat expansions leading to Friedreich ataxia, Huntington disease, fragile X syndrome, and myotonic dystrophies involve formation of non-B DNA structures that impair normal cellular processes. The clinical assessment of these structures requires sophisticated computational approaches that can accurately predict structure formation, assess pathogenicity, and guide therapeutic interventions.

### Limitations of Current Approaches

Existing computational tools for non-B DNA prediction suffer from several critical limitations: (1) limited motif coverage focusing primarily on G-quadruplexes; (2) lack of clinical interpretation and disease-associated variant classification; (3) absence of machine learning integration for enhanced prediction accuracy; (4) poor user interfaces limiting accessibility; (5) insufficient performance for genome-wide analysis; and (6) limited visualization capabilities for publication-quality output.

### NBDFinder 2.0: A Paradigm Shift

To address these limitations, we developed NBDFinder 2.0, the most advanced non-B DNA prediction platform incorporating cutting-edge algorithms, machine learning enhancement, clinical variant classification, and comprehensive visualization capabilities. The platform represents a complete reimagining of structural genomics tools, designed to meet the needs of both basic researchers and clinical practitioners in the genomic medicine era.
