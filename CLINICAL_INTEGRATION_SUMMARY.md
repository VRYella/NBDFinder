# NBDFinder Clinical Integration Summary

## Implementation Overview

NBDFinder has been successfully upgraded with comprehensive clinical analysis integration and literature-based threshold implementation. The platform now provides rigorous, clinically-relevant non-B DNA motif detection suitable for research and clinical applications.

## Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. Literature-Based Threshold Updates
All motif detection algorithms have been updated with stringent, literature-based cutoffs:

- **G4-Quadruplex**: G4Hunter threshold 0.8 → 1.2 (Bedrat et al. NAR 2016, PMID: 26673694)
- **G-Triplex**: Increased threshold to 1.5 for higher stringency
- **R-loop**: Minimum total length 50bp → 100bp, REZ GC content 30% → 50% (Ginno et al. 2012, PMID: 22243696)
- **Z-DNA**: Scoring threshold 45.0 → 50.0 (Rich & Zhang 2003, PMID: 12690205)
- **i-motif**: Relaxed threshold 0.25 → 0.30 (PMID: 24240478)
- **Slipped DNA**: Score threshold 8.0 → 10.0 (Mirkin 2007, PMID: 17110380)
- **Triplex DNA**: Minimum arms 8bp → 10bp, total length 18bp → 25bp, score 18.0 → 25.0

### 2. Clinical Analysis Integration
Comprehensive disease motif detection and clinical interpretation:

- **Intelligent Disease Prioritization**: Repeat count-based matching for accurate clinical correlation
- **Pathogenic Repeat Detection**: GAA (Friedreich's), CGG (Fragile X), CAG (Huntington's), CTG (Myotonic Dystrophy)
- **Clinical Significance Classification**: Following ACMG guidelines (Pathogenic, Likely Pathogenic, VUS, Benign)
- **Risk Stratification**: Quantitative risk scoring (Very High ≥85%, High 70-84%, Moderate 50-69%, Low <50%)
- **Population Frequency Analysis**: Percentile scoring for clinical context
- **Therapeutic Targeting**: Evidence-based treatment recommendations
- **Genetic Counseling**: Inheritance pattern and family screening guidance

### 3. Enhanced Interface
Fully functional clinical analysis dashboard:

- **Disease Motif Results**: Comprehensive pathogenic variant analysis
- **Clinical Summary**: Risk assessment and interpretation
- **Database Links**: Integration with ClinVar, OMIM, GTR, ClinGen
- **Professional Guidelines**: ACMG, AMP, CAP, NSGC references
- **Export Functionality**: Clinical data included in all exports
